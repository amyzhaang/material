Run test suite with `python3 -m unittest test`

Caveats:
- Some operations may not be the most performant.
- Test suite is not comprehensive.
- Should add docstrings and parameter/return type annotations.

Other ideas:
- Make graph doubly connected so it's possible to traverse backwards.

first_attempt.py contains code from my initial approach at this problem, before I pivoted to a more production-quality approach.
